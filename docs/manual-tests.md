# Manual tests

Everything in Glacier that only a person can check, by clicking and typing in the browser. The robots test the logic with `node --test`, but they can't open Chrome or Firefox.

**How to use this list**

- Reload Glacier first: ↻ in `chrome://extensions` and in Firefox `about:debugging`.
- Do each test in **both** Chrome and Firefox.
- Section 1 is what still needs a first check. Section 2 is the full list, for a check of everything before a release (#41) or after a big change.
- You need: two websites (an article and a video work well), a new tab, and a settings page (`chrome://settings` or `about:preferences`).

## 1. Still to test

Nothing right now.

## 2. Everything

### Opening Glacier

- [ ] The toolbar button opens Glacier.
- [ ] Alt+Shift+G opens Glacier, and pressing it again closes it. Try it from the web page and while typing in a note.
- [ ] Type something, close with the shortcut right away, reopen: the text is still there.
- [ ] When the sidebar opens, the cursor is already in the note.

### Permission and first start

- [ ] Fresh start without the permission: only a "+ Lesson note" button shows.
- [ ] Click it: Glacier's own card explains the permission. **Allow** shows the browser's prompt, and then the page's note or form.
- [ ] **Not now** leads to a form for a note made by hand.

### Notes for the page you're on

- [ ] On a website without a note, "+ Lesson note" shows. The new note gets the page title, and the last used Course is already picked.
- [ ] Reopening the sidebar on that page opens the same note again.
- [ ] Two videos on the same site (different `?v=`) get different notes.
- [ ] The same page with `#part-2` or `?utm_source=mail` at the end opens the same note.

### Switching tabs

- [ ] Switching to another website shows its note, or its "+ Lesson note" form. That happens whatever note was open, including one you just made or opened from the pill.
- [ ] Switching back shows the first tab's note again.
- [ ] On a new tab or a settings page, the open note stays.
- [ ] Switching quickly between several tabs always ends on the note of the tab you're on.
- [ ] Text typed just before switching is saved in the right note.

### The pill at the top

- [ ] The pill shows the note's title and a sync dot.
- [ ] Clicking the pill, or Ctrl+K, opens the menu with the search box ready.
- [ ] Search finds words in titles and in the text, with the match highlighted. Clicking a result opens it and closes the menu.
- [ ] Recent notes are listed, including notes made by hand.
- [ ] The Notebook is listed: Courses with their Lesson notes, and Concepts.
- [ ] Esc closes the menu.
- [ ] `←` appears after the note changed. Hovering shows "Back to: <title>". Clicking goes back one note, and clicking again goes further back.
- [ ] `+` is always there. On a website it offers "Lesson note for this page" and "Concept note". On a settings page it offers "New note" and "Concept note".
- [ ] Hovering over Lesson note or Concept note (in `+` and in the menu) shows a short explanation.

### Saving

- [ ] There's no save button. Type, reload the page: the text is still there.
- [ ] Type, close the sidebar right away, reopen: the text is still there.
- [ ] Several lines and an empty line in between survive a reload exactly.
- [ ] Notes are still there after closing and restarting the whole browser.
- [ ] Type in note A, follow a link to B straight away, go back: each note has its own text.

### Writing

- [ ] Click anywhere on the paper, even far below the text: you can write there at once.
- [ ] Click to the right of a short line: the cursor goes to the end of that line.
- [ ] Click far below and then somewhere else without typing: no empty lines are left behind.
- [ ] Clicking on a word, also in a list line or a heading, puts the cursor exactly there.
- [ ] Enter makes a new line and continues a list. Enter on an empty list line ends the list.
- [ ] Backspace at the start of a line joins it with the line above.
- [ ] ↑ and ↓ move between lines, also through code blocks.
- [ ] Pasting from a website gives plain text, and several lines become several lines.
- [ ] The text sits on the ruled lines everywhere.

### Formatting while typing

- [ ] `## ` turns the line into a heading at once, with `##` faded.
- [ ] `- ` makes a list line, `> ` a quote, three backticks a code block.
- [ ] `**key**` turns bold the moment the second `**` is typed, and the cursor doesn't jump.
- [ ] `*italic*`, `***both***`, `` `code` `` and `[Google](https://google.com)` format with faded marks.
- [ ] `**word` without the closing marks stays plain.
- [ ] `snake_case` and `2*3` stay plain.
- [ ] Every line you're not on shows finished formatting, with the marks hidden.

### Formatting shortcuts

- [ ] Select a word, Ctrl+B: bold. Then Ctrl+I: bold and italic. Ctrl+B again removes the bold.
- [ ] Nothing selected: Ctrl+B, type "hello", Ctrl+B, type more. Only "hello" is bold.
- [ ] Select partly bold text, Ctrl+B: all of it is bold, with no leftover marks inside.
- [ ] Select three list lines, Ctrl+B: each line is bold, and the bullets stay.
- [ ] Ctrl+E makes `code`, and pressing it again removes it.
- [ ] In a code block, Ctrl+B and Ctrl+I do nothing.
- [ ] Firefox's bookmarks sidebar doesn't open on Ctrl+B, and the search bar doesn't jump on Ctrl+E.

### Enter inside formatting

- [ ] Type `**key`, so the cursor is inside bold. Enter jumps out past `**` on the same line. A second Enter makes a new line.
- [ ] Inside bold, Shift+Enter starts a new line that is still bold.

### Undo and redo

- [ ] Ctrl+Z steps back through your writing, also through Enter, Backspace and formatting.
- [ ] Ctrl+Shift+Z and Ctrl+Y step forward again.
- [ ] Text and faded marks look right at every step.

### The `/` menu and the `+` on the left

- [ ] `/` at the start of a line opens the menu. Every command shows its Markdown.
- [ ] Typing `/he` filters to the headings. ↑/↓ and Enter or Tab pick, Esc closes, and the mouse wheel scrolls.
- [ ] `/` in the middle of a line or in a code block opens nothing.
- [ ] The `+` on the left opens the same menu, on a new line when the line already has text.
- [ ] `+` and then Esc, Enter, a paste or following a link leaves no stray `/` behind.
- [ ] Empty lines show the hint "Type / for commands, or click + on the left".

### Links

- [ ] `[[` plus the first letters of a title shows matching notes. ↑/↓ and Enter or Tab complete the link, and Esc closes the list.
- [ ] A link to an existing note looks different from a link to a missing one.
- [ ] Clicking a link opens that note. Clicking a missing link creates a Concept note with that name and opens it.
- [ ] Concept notes have no Course.
- [ ] Note A contains `[[B]]`. Open B: a small button at the bottom left shows `1`.
- [ ] Click it: A is listed. Click A: it opens.

### Renaming

- [ ] Pill menu, **Rename**, give B a new name. In A the link now shows the new name.
- [ ] Renaming to a name that's already taken is refused, and a free name is suggested.
- [ ] After a rename the note stays open and its backlinks still work.

### Selecting and copying

- [ ] Drag over several lines: they get selected. A single click still puts the cursor there.
- [ ] Ctrl+A once selects the line, twice the whole note, never the web page.
- [ ] Ctrl+C shows a short message with the number of lines copied.
- [ ] Paste into another note: headings, lists, links and code come back as the same Markdown.

### Code blocks

- [ ] Backspace at the start of a code block keeps both ``` lines intact.
- [ ] Backspace on the line after a code block doesn't merge into it.

### How it reads

- [ ] No text in Glacier uses dashes as punctuation, words in capitals, or emoji.

### Export and Import

- [ ] A Lesson note with a Course and a website shows a small "Course · source ↗" line above its text, and no `---` lines. Clicking "source ↗" opens the lesson in a new tab.
- [ ] A Lesson note made by hand (no website) shows only its Course. A Concept note shows no such line.
- [ ] Open the pill menu: Export and Import sit at the bottom, and hovering shows what they do.
- [ ] Export downloads a zip named "Glacier notes" with the date.
- [ ] Unzip it: Lesson notes are in `courses/<Course>/`, Concept notes in `concepts/`, each file named after its title with a short block of details at the top.
- [ ] In Obsidian, "Open folder as vault" on the unzipped folder: the notes open and clicking a Link goes to the other note.
- [ ] Import that zip again: a message says no notes were added and all were already here, and nothing changed.
- [ ] Change a note, then Import the older zip: your note keeps your change, and the older text appears as a second note with "(imported" and the date in its title.
- [ ] Import a zip into a fresh Glacier (or another browser): every note comes back with its text, Course and website.
- [ ] Import a file that isn't a zip: a message says it couldn't be read, and nothing changed.
